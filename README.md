# Generating training data using CDL (work in progress)
* CDL (Cropland Data Layer) is a data source provided by USDA which contains ground truth labels for a majority of USA.
* This repository contains some simple ipython notebooks for generating a shapefile of ground truth (point/polygon) from these CDL imagery.
* Each jupyter notebook can be customized to specific classes you want to extract and the final data is stored in the form of a shapefile.
